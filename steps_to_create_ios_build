The process to make an IOS Build

1. Create a CSR  - Certificate Signing Request (your Mac certificate)
    1. Search for a Keychain Access 
    2. Certificate Assistant -> Request a certificate from a Certificate Authority
    3. Enter the detail asked like the user email address and ca email address(both can be the same)
    4. Save to Disk and Continue
    
2. Xcode Set-Up
    1. Open Xcode from IOS  folder of your flutter app and select Preferences
    2. Accounts -> Create an account and add your Apple ID
    
3. Two ways of Signing
    1. If selected automatically - everything is managed by Xcode itself
    2. Manual Process
        1. Go to appstoreconnect.apple.com
        2. If you are an account holder or Admin then Select Users and Access and create a new user with access needed
        3. Or ask the Account Holder or Admin to provide user
